# Module-14-lock-n-board

## **Description**

**Lock N Board** is a full-stack Kanban board application that helps users organize tasks in a visual and intuitive swimlane layout. Built with TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, and React, it allows users to register, log in, and manage their tickets across "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns. Inspired by agile methodology, the project was developed for educational purposes and demonstrates modern full-stack development practices.

Users can:

- Register for a new account or log in securely
- Create, update, and delete task tickets
- View all tickets sorted into categorized swimlanes
- Persist data across sessions with a PostgreSQL database
- Enjoy responsive UI and error handling

This tool is ideal for students, developers, and project managers seeking a simple, extensible task board experience.
